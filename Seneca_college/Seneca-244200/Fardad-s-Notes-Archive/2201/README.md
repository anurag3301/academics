# OOP244 NAB 2201 in-class notes and material 

## Git
[Pro Git Book](https://git-scm.com/book): This is and online complete reference to git and its commands (command line). I recommend reading chapter 1 and 2 and glancing chapter 6. This will be more than enough to get your through atleast first three semesters of college, if not all. <br />
